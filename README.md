# macOS Hidden Settings

This repo covers six hidden macOS settings that I found useful. The settings are:

- Use Touch ID to authenticate sudo
- Eliminate Dock's pop-up delay
- Scroll up on Dock icon to show all opened windows for that application
- Enable key repeats
- Dim hidden apps in the Dock
- Show crash reporter as a notification

To run the setup, simply clone the repo and run the `run.sh` script.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chanyatfu/macos-hidden-settings.git
cd macos-hidden-settings
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
