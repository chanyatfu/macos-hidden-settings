# Hidden macOS setting

This repo covers six hidden macOS settings that I found useful. The settings are:

- Eliminate Dock's auto-hide delay
- Show crash reporter as a notification
- Dim hidden apps in the Dock
- Scroll up on Dock app's icon to show all opened windows
- Enable key repeats
- Use Touch ID to authenticate sudo

To run the setup, simply clone the repo and run the `run.sh` script.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chanyatfu/hidden-macos-setup.git
cd hidden-macos-setup
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
